Pending Post Notifier Plus will send a notification to given email address of posts pending review by contributors as with WP Pending Post Notifier. In addition though, it allows you to split users into groups with separate moderators for each group

== Description ==

PLEASE NOTE: This project is no longer being maintained and may have stability issues with more recent versions of Wordpress

Pending Post Notifier Plus is an enhanced version of WP Pending Post Notifier. As with the previous version, it will send a notification to given email address of posts pending review by contributors. It can also optionally notify the contributors when their post is accepted or rejected. WP Status Notifier is useful for moderation in blogs with multiple contributors. In addition though, it allows users to be split into groups, each with a separate moderator. These moderators will only receive pending notifications from members of their group, making managing larger scale projects much easier.

The plugin will add an options page in the Wordpress administration area where you can set one or more email addresses to notified of posts pending review, as well as create groups and group moderators. On creation, each of the groups will require the moderators email and one members email.
